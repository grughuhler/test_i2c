This directory contains an i2c test program that assumes the i2c
target device has 8-bit registers 0 to 3, all bits of which can be
read and written.

Install these packages, i2c-tools is to get i2cdetect, etc:

   sudo apt install i2c-tools libi2c-dev

Then "make" and run test_i2c without arguments.
